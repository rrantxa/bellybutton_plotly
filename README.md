# Belly Button Biodiversity: A Plotly Project
## *Purpose of the Project*
The purpose of this project was to build a dashboard that could help users inspect data concerning the types of bacteria cultures found on a set of human subjects' belly buttons. This information would be used to determine the most common types and amounts of bacteria cultures found, which would, in turn, help researchers determine if belly button bacteria could help create vegan meat in a laboratory.The visualizations can be found in the following domain: https://rrantxa.github.io/bellybutton_plotly/

On the other hand, this project was completed using the following programming languages:
1. HTML
2. Javascript (and Plotly)
3. CSS
